# Conscious Artificial Intelligence: Theory and Limits

This repository contains my Honours research in Computer Science, completed at the University of the Witwatersrand.

The project investigates what theoretical conditions an artificial system would need to satisfy to be considered conscious, and whether contemporary AI systems meaningfully approach those conditions.

## 🧠 Motivation
As AI systems grow increasingly capable, questions about their cognitive and conscious status move from science fiction into serious academic debate. This work aims to clarify which theoretical commitments must be met before claims of conscious AI can be taken seriously.
